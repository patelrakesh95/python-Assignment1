Array in Python
1. Class name: ArrayPopulation.py
2. Inputs: 2 int array of "n" number of elements; both array should have same number of elements.     Method name: populateArray()
3. Output: 1 array of having "n+n" elements.
4. Logic: Populate the first two arrays. transfer the contents of the first array into the odd positions of the resultant array and the contents of the second array to the even positions of the resultant array
5. The method should return the resultant array to the caller
6. A separate method should be there to print the contents of the resultant array. (method: print())
7. Caller class Name: PopulateArray; should first invoke the method by passing 2 integer arrays of 5 elements each and then call print method by passing resultant Array to print the resultant array's elements.
